## Prerequisites
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)) installed on your development machine. If you do not have Python, visit the previous link for download options. (**Note:** This tutorial was written with Python version 3.7.9 and Django version 3.2.15 The steps in this guide may work with other versions, but that has not been tested.)
